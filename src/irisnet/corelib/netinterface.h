/**
   \brief Provides information about a network interface

   NetInterface provides information about a particular network interface.  Construct it by passing the interface id of interest (e.g. "eth0") and a NetInterfaceManager parent object.  Interface ids can be obtained from NetInterfaceManager.

   To test if a NetInterface is valid, call isValid().  Use name() to return a display-friendly name of the interface.  The addresses() function returns a list of IP addresses for this interface.

   Here's an example of how to print the IP addresses of eth0:
   \code
NetInterface iface("eth0");
if(iface.isValid())
{
    QList<QHostAddress> addrs = iface.addresses();
    for(int n = 0; n < addrs.count(); ++n)
        printf("%s\n", qPrintable(addrs[n].toString()));
}
   \endcode

   If the interface goes away, the unavailable() signal is emitted and the NetInterface becomes invalid.

/**
   \brief Manages network interface information

   NetInterfaceManager keeps track of all available network interfaces.

   An interface is considered available if it exists, is "Up", has at least one IP address, and is non-Loopback.

   The interfaces() function returns a list of available interface ids.  These ids can be used with NetInterface to get information about the interfaces.  For example, here is how you could print the names of the available interfaces:

   \code
NetInterfaceManager netman;
QStringList id_list = netman.interfaces();
for(int n = 0; n < id_list.count(); ++n)
{
    NetInterface iface(id_list[n], &netman);
    printf("name: [%s]\n", qPrintable(iface.name()));
}
   \endcode

   When a new network interface is available, the interfaceAvailable() signal will be emitted.  Note that interface unavailability is not notified by NetInterfaceManager.  Instead, use NetInterface to monitor a specific network interface for unavailability.

   Interface ids obtained through NetInterfaceManager are guaranteed to be valid until the event loop resumes, or until the next call to interfaces() or interfaceForAddress().
