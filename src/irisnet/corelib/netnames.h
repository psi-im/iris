/**
   \brief Provides a DNS record

   NameRecord provides a DNS (Domain Name System) record, which is information assicated with a domain name.  For most purposes, the information is an IP address.  However, DNS records are capable of holding a variety of data types, such as named pointers to other domain names and even arbitrary text strings.  The results of a NameResolver operation are a list of NameRecords.

   The most common type is the address record, "A", which contains an IPv4 address.  Here is an example of how to get the IP address out of an address record:

\code
NameRecord record = ... // obtain a record from somewhere
if(record.type() == NameRecord::A)
{
	QHostAddress ip = record.address(); // get the IP
	...
}
\endcode

   Getting the data out of a NameRecord involves calling the right retrieval functions, depending on the type.  Many types share retrieval functions.  For example, the "AAAA" type holds an IPv6 address, which is accessed the same way as the "A" type, by calling address().  See the NameRecord::Type enum for further information about which retrieval functions should be called for each type.

   To create a NameRecord, use setOwner() and setTtl() as necessary, and then call one of the set<em>X</em> functions (where <em>X</em> is the desired type).  For example, to set an A or AAAA record, use setAddress() like this:

\code
// make example.com the owner, with 1 hour TTL
NameRecord record("example.com", 3600);
record.setAddress(QHostAddress("1.2.3.4"));
\endcode

   Note that in the case of setAddress(), the record type need not be specified.  NameRecord will determine the type to use based on the given QHostAddress.

/**
   \brief Performs a DNS lookup

   NameResolver performs an asynchronous DNS lookup for a given domain name and record type.  Call start() to begin.  The resultsReady() signal is emitted on success, otherwise error() is emitted.  To cancel a lookup, call stop().

   Each NameResolver object can only perform one DNS lookup at a time.  If start() is called while a lookup is already in progress, then the existing lookup is stopped before starting the new lookup.

   Each NameResolver object should be used for just one DNS query and then be deleted.
   Otherwise ambiguity might arise when receiving multiple answers to future queries.

   For example, here is how to obtain the IPv4 addresses of a domain name:
\code
NameResolver *resolver;

void do_lookup()
{
	resolver = new NameResolver;
	connect(resolver, SIGNAL(resultsReady(const QList<XMPP::NameRecord> &)),
		SLOT(dns_resultsReady(const QList<XMPP::NameRecord> &)));
	connect(resolver, SIGNAL(error(XMPP::NameResolver::Error)),
		SLOT(dns_error(XMPP::NameResolver::Error)));

	// look up affinix.com
	resolver->start("affinix.com");
}

void dns_resultsReady(const QList<XMPP::NameRecord> &results)
{
	// print IP addresses
	foreach(NameRecord i, results)
		printf("%s\n", qPrintable(i.address().toString()));
}

void dns_error(XMPP::NameResolver::Error error)
{
	// handle error
	...
}
\endcode

   Yes, a domain name can have multiple IP addresses.  Many applications ignore this fact, and use only one of the answers.  A proper network application should try connecting to each IP address until one succeeds.

   To lookup other types, pass the desired type to start().  For example, suppose you want to look up the MX record of a domain name:

\code
// look up the MX record for affinix.com
resolver->start("affinix.com", NameRecord::Mx);
\endcode

   It is also possible to perform long-lived queries.  This is generally useful for DNS Service Discovery.  Long-lived queries are continuous, and resultsReady() may be emitted multiple times.  Unlike a normal lookup, which stops once the results are returned, a long-lived query will keep going until stop() is called.

   For example, suppose you want to scan the local network for SSH services.  According to the DNS-SD protocol, this is done by querying for the name "_ssh._tcp.local." of type PTR.

\code
// monitor for SSH services on the local network
resolver->start("_ssh._tcp.local.", NameRecord::Ptr, NameResolver::LongLived);
\endcode

   Don't be alarmed by the trailing dot (".") character in this last example.  It is not well known, but all valid DNS domain names end with a dot.  However, NameResolver, like most DNS programming interfaces, allows the dot to be left out.  What this means is that if a trailing dot is missing in the input to start(), NameResolver will internally append one before performing the query.
