/**
   \brief Listens for termination requests

   ProcessQuit listens for requests to terminate the application process.  On Unix platforms, these are the signals
   SIGINT, SIGHUP, and SIGTERM.  On Windows, these are the console control events for Ctrl+C, console window close, and
   system shutdown.  For Windows GUI programs, ProcessQuit has no effect.

   For GUI programs, ProcessQuit is not a substitute for QSessionManager.  The only safe way to handle termination of a
   GUI program in the usual way is to use QSessionManager.  However, ProcessQuit does give additional benefit to
   Unix GUI programs that might be terminated unconventionally, so it can't hurt to support both.

   When a termination request is received, the application should exit gracefully, and generally without user
   interaction.  Otherwise, it is at risk of being terminated outside of its control.  For example, if a Windows console
   application does not exit after just a few seconds of attempting to close the console window, Windows will display
   a prompt to the user asking if the process should be ended immediately.

   Using ProcessQuit is easy, and it usually amounts to a single line:
   \code
myapp.connect(ProcessQuit::instance(), SIGNAL(quit()), SLOT(do_quit()));
   \endcode

   Calling instance() returns a pointer to the global ProcessQuit instance, which will be created if necessary.
   The quit() signal is emitted when a request to terminate is received. The quit() signal is only emitted once,
   future termination requests are ignored.  Call reset() to allow the quit() signal to be emitted again.

This is normally the desired behavior, but if you are ignoring the termination request then you may want to allow future notifications.  Calling this function will allow the quit() signal to be emitted again, if a new termination request arrives.
