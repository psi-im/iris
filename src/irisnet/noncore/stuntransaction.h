// Notes:
//
// - we allow multiple simultaneous requests.  no serializing or waiting, at
//   least not at the transaction layer.
// - requests may require authentication.  the protocol flow for STUN is that
//   you first try a request without providing credentials, and if
//   authentication is needed then an error is returned.  the request must be
//   tried again with credentials provided for it to succeed.  note that the
//   error response contains a nonce value that must be passed back in the
//   second request, and so the first request cannot be skipped.
// - it is possible to provide credentials in advance, so that the user is not
//   asked for them dynamically.  however, the protocol flow remains the same
//   either way (i.e. request w/o creds, error, request with creds).
// - the user is only asked for credentials once ever.  if two requests require
//   authentication, the user is asked only once and both requests will be
//   retried once the creds are provided.  if an authentication error is
//   received after providing creds, then the transaction will fail.  this
//   means the user only has one chance to get the creds right, and creds
//   cannot change during a session.  in the event of failure due to wrong or
//   changed creds, the pool will need to be recreated in order to try new
//   creds.
// - if short term or long term auth is used, then the request is authenticated
//   and the response is required to be authenticated.
