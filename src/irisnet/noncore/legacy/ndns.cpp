//! \class NDns ndns.h
//! \brief Simple DNS resolution using native system calls
//!
//! This class is to be used when Qt's QDns is not good enough.  Because QDns
//! does not use threads, it cannot make a system call asyncronously.  Thus,
//! QDns tries to imitate the behavior of each platform's native behavior, and
//! generally falls short.
//!
//! NDns uses a thread to make the system call happen in the background.  This
//! gives your program native DNS behavior, at the cost of requiring threads
//! to build.
//!
//! \code
//! #include "ndns.h"
//!
//! ...
//!
//! NDns dns;
//! dns.resolve("psi.affinix.com");
//!
//! // The class will emit the resultsReady() signal when the resolution
//! // is finished. You may then retrieve the results:
//!
//! uint ip_address = dns.result();
//!
//! // or if you want to get the IP address as a string:
//!
//! QString ip_address = dns.resultString();
//! \endcode

#include "ndns.h"
